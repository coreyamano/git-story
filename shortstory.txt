Once upon a time there was a little green alien who lived in a rocket.
The alien lived with his other green alien friends.
The king of the aliens was a giant metal claw. 

Sometimes the giant claw would take one of the aliens away and send them to a new home.

One of the aliens fount a home at github.com.
